    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature</em>, <em>New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.</p>
